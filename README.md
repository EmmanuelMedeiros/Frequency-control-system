## Description

- This application is a workforce attendance tracking system designed to monitor and manage employee check-ins with added security and customization. It features a role-based authentication system with two roles: admin and employee. Employees can log their attendance, view their extra or missing hours, and check for any absences. Admins, on the other hand, have access to advanced management features.

- To register an entry, employees must select their profile and take a photo using the deviceâ€™s native camera. This photo is saved in the database (as a base64 string) along with the employee's ID and the exact timestamp.

- All endpoints are protected by JWT-based authorization, ensuring secure access to all system features.

- For reporting, the system offers two key tools:
    - A detailed report, which generates an XLSX file with all attendance entries for a selected time period, including user, date, and time.
    - A daily report, where admins can view all check-ins for a specific user and day, including the corresponding photos and timestamps.
    - Additionally, the system supports custom work schedules, allowing admins to define each employee's workload, working hours, and days off based on specific needs.
